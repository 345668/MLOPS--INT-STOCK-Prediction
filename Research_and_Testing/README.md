# Autotrade Project

This repository is dedicated to developing an automated trading system. The project is structured into various modules, each serving a specific function within the trading bot pipeline. Below is a detailed explanation of the different components and how they integrate to build a complete autotrading system.

## Project Overview

The aim of the project is to develop a stock trading bot using various machine learning models, feature engineering techniques, and reinforcement learning strategies. The key objectives include backtesting strategies, implementing advanced alpha factor research, and analyzing sentiment from real-time data to inform trading decisions.

## Folder Structure

### 1. `alpha_factor_research/`
This folder contains research and development notebooks focused on creating alpha factors. Alpha factors are signals or indicators that predict the future price movements of securities.

### 2. `automation/`
Scripts to automate tasks like data collection, model retraining, and deployment. This ensures that the trading bot continuously adapts to new market data.

### 3. `backtesting/`
Backtesting scripts for evaluating the performance of different strategies using historical data. We use libraries like Zipline and Backtrader to backtest strategies and ensure robustness before real-world deployment.

### 4. `clustering/`
Contains notebooks and scripts related to clustering algorithms for identifying patterns in financial data. This includes methods like K-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models.

### 5. `conda_environments/`
This folder stores the Conda environment `.yml` files used to replicate the environments for this project. These files allow for easy setup of the required packages and libraries in a Conda environment.

### 6. `data/`
This directory stores all the datasets used in the project. The data includes stock price history, market data, order book data, and sentiment data.

### 7. `data_creation/`
Scripts and notebooks that generate processed datasets from raw data sources. This includes parsing NASDAQ ITCH order flow data, EDGAR SEC filings, and market trade/quote data from Algoseek.

### 8. `deployment/`
Scripts to set up APIs and deploy the trading bot. This folder also includes Docker configurations for containerization and cloud deployment scripts.

### 9. `feature_engineering_gradient_boosting/`
Notebooks focused on feature engineering, specifically for models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM). This includes creating features like momentum factors, Fama-French factors, and lagged returns.

### 10. `gradient_boosting/`
Contains notebooks that implement and tune Gradient Boosting Models (GBM) using LightGBM and CatBoost. These models are used to generate trading signals.

### 11. `logging/`
Logging configurations and scripts that record model performance, trades, and other operational data, crucial for monitoring and debugging.

### 12. `model_evaluation/`
Scripts and notebooks dedicated to evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and IC (Information Coefficient).

### 13. `model_diagnostics/`
Includes notebooks for diagnosing model behavior, identifying issues like bias and variance, and improving model performance.

### 14. `modeling/`
Contains general modeling scripts that integrate different machine learning algorithms, from decision trees to reinforcement learning strategies.

### 15. `nlp/`
This folder is focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling. The goal is to integrate real-time financial news data to enhance trading decisions.

### 16. `performance_evaluation/`
Scripts to evaluate trading strategies, focusing on various performance metrics like Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, and drawdowns.

### 17. `risk_management/`
Contains scripts for calculating and applying risk management techniques such as stop-loss strategies, position sizing, and portfolio risk optimization.

### 18. `sentiment_analysis/`
Contains notebooks for extracting sentiment from news articles, social media, and financial reports. This sentiment data is used to inform the trading strategy.

### 19. `strategy_evaluation/`
This folder stores evaluations of different trading strategies. It includes code to compare the effectiveness of each strategy and to analyze the risks and returns.

### 20. `topic_modeling/`
Includes scripts for topic modeling to classify news articles or earnings reports, helping to gauge market sentiment around particular companies or sectors.

### 21. `word_embeddings/`
Contains word embedding models like FastText or Word2Vec, fine-tuned to financial data, used to process and analyze text data such as news headlines or SEC filings.

### 22. `yahoo_finance/`
Scripts and notebooks for extracting real-time stock data using the Yahoo Finance API. This data is used for real-time predictions and strategy execution.
