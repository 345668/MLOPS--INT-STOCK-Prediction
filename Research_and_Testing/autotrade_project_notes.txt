Project: Autotrade Bot with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning

### Goals:
1. Automate the stock/crypto trading process using AI/ML.
2. Build a pipeline that integrates both traditional models (LightGBM/CatBoost) and deep learning models (LSTM).
3. Incorporate reinforcement learning (Deep Q-Learning, PPO) for optimizing trading strategies.

### Key Components:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering:
- Use historical and intraday market data.
- Apply technical indicators like RSI, moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- Create features using notebooks like:
  - 04_preparing_the_model_data.ipynb
  - 01_feature_engineering.ipynb
  - 10_intraday_features.ipynb

#### 2. Model Training:
- **Gradient Boosting Models** (LightGBM/CatBoost) to generate baseline predictions.
  - Use notebooks like 01_boosting_baseline.ipynb and 05_trading_signals_with_lightgbm_and_catboost.ipynb.
- **LSTM** for sequential prediction of future stock prices or indicators.
- **Reinforcement Learning** (DQL, PPO) for optimizing trade execution strategies.

#### 3. Backtesting & Evaluation:
- Backtest strategies using notebooks like 09_backtesting_with_zipline.ipynb.
- Evaluate models with 06_evaluate_trading_signals.ipynb.

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline:
- **MLflow** or **Kubeflow** for managing the model lifecycle (training, evaluation, deployment).
- **GitHub Actions** for automating model retraining, testing, and deployment.
- **Prometheus** for monitoring model performance in production and triggering retraining if necessary.

#### 5. Model Serving & Deployment:
- Deploy models using tools like **AWS SageMaker** or **Baseten** for continuous serving.
- Set up APIs to serve models for real-time trading signals.
- Containerize models using **Docker** for portability.

### Action Plan:

1. **Step 1: Specifications and API Development**
   - Deadline: September 20th
   - Define the project's context, and identify processes that can be automated using AI/ML.
   - Develop the API for serving models and trading signals.
   
2. **Step 2: Isolation & CI/CD**
   - Deadline: October 4th
   - Set up containerized environments using Docker.
   - Implement CI/CD workflows for continuous training, testing, and deployment.
   - Automate model monitoring and retraining.

### Tools/Frameworks:
- **LightGBM**, **CatBoost** for baseline models.
- **LSTM** for time-series forecasting.
- **Reinforcement Learning (PPO, DQL)** for trade optimization.
- **MLflow**, **Kubeflow** for model lifecycle management.
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD.
- **Prometheus** for monitoring.
- **AWS SageMaker**, **Baseten** for model serving and deployment.
